# Available Category Collections

CoMapeo uses customizable categories (icons with names) to organize and visualize mapping data. Communities can adapt these to their specific monitoring needs and contexts.

The [CoMapeo Categories Library](https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/toolkit/comapeo-categories-library/) on the Earth Defenders Toolkit website provides three pre-built collections that you can try out with CoMapeo:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Impact Monitoring
Categories for documenting external threats and environmental impacts from industries, illegal activities, and pollution.

### üê¶ Biodiversity Monitoring
Categories for mapping and monitoring wildlife, plants, water bodies, and other forms of biodiversity within territories.

### üåÄ Cultural Mapping
Categories for documenting traditional ecological knowledge, cultural sites, and ancestral relationships with the land.

### üîß Customization and Development
All category collections are available on GitHub at [digidem/comapeo-category-library](https://github.com/digidem/comapeo-category-library) where you can fork the repository for further customization to meet your community's specific needs.
