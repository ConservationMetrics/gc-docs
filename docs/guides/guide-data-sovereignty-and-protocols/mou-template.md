**And:** <span className="template-highlight">[Third-Party Organization Name]</span>  
**Date:** <span className="template-highlight">[Date]</span>

## **Purpose and Principles**

This Memorandum of Understanding ("MoU") is grounded in the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty (hereafter "IDSov"), recognizing and upholding the rights of <span className="template-highlight">[Community or Organization Name]</span> to control, govern, and steward their own data. The agreement acknowledges the collective ownership of data by Indigenous communities and the relational, reciprocal nature of Indigenous data, which is an extension of their sovereignty, cultural heritage, and self-determination. This MoU constitutes an expression of mutual intent, and is not a legally binding obligation.

This MoU is designed to ensure that any data shared aligns with the principles and values of IDSov. These values include:

1. **Self-Determination**: The community retains autonomous control over all decisions related to the collection, access, use, and dissemination of their data.  
2. **Collective Ownership and Governance**: Data from or about the community remains under their collective governance, to be used in ways that reflect their priorities, values, and cultural perspectives.  
3. **Protection and Stewardship**: This agreement ensures that the communityâ€™s data is safeguarded against misuse, unauthorized access, and potential exploitation.

## **Terms of Agreement**

1. **Ownership and Control**

3. **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)**  
   This MoU emphasizes Free, Prior, and Informed Consent ("FPIC") as a cornerstone of IDSov. The <span className="template-highlight">[Community or Organization Name]</span> reserves the right to withdraw consent at any point if the data's use no longer aligns with community interests.  
4. **Access and Security**
