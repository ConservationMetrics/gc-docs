# Guardian Connector Toolkit

## GC Scripts Hub

The [GC Scripts Hub](./gc-scripts-hub/) is a collection of automation scripts designed to help communities guard and manage their land through data integration and workflow automation. Built on the [Windmill](https://www.windmill.dev/) platform, these scripts empower communities to connect different tools, automate data collection, and streamline their conservation workflows without requiring deep technical expertise.

## GC Explorer

The [GC Explorer](./gc-explorer/) is a web-based data visualization tool that transforms your community's tabular data into interactive maps, galleries, and dashboards. Built specifically for Guardian Connector, it connects directly to your PostgreSQL database to display data collected from tools like CoMapeo, KoboToolbox, and other data collection platforms.


## Externally Hosted Services

Guardian Connector also relies on several third party services (that are not hosted on a Guardian Connector instance) to provide additional functionality:

- [Auth0](./externally-hosted/auth0/) - Authentication and authorization platform
- [Mapbox](./externally-hosted/mapbox/) - Mapping and geospatial data visualization platform
- [Twilio](./externally-hosted/twilio/) - SMS and voice communication platform
- [Uptime Robot](./externally-hosted/uptime-robot/) - Website monitoring and uptime tracking
