# Step 3: Sensor Deployment

## Placement Guidance

-   Mount units 1.5–2 m above ground for general biodiversity
    monitoring; higher placements reduce ground reflection noise.

-   Keep sensors away from vegetation that may strike the case in wind
    (this will cause loud noise on the recordings).

-   Orient the microphone toward the primary sound source when relevant
    (e.g., bird choruses, wildlife trails) and away from persistent
    sound sources (rivers/streams, roads, dominant wind direction).

-   For rainfall-prone sites, a small rain shield placed above the
    sensor can reduce noise without overly obstructing sound.

## Prepare for Deployment

Record the following on the deployment datasheet:

-   Device ID

-   SD card ID

-   Survey point ID (SPID)

-   Deployment date/time

## Create an Intro Recording

1.  Remove AudioMoth from housing.

2.  Switch to **Default** to start immediate recording.

3.  Ensure red LED flashes.

4.  Record audio notes:

    > “This is [name] on [date] at [time]. Site: [SPID]. Sensor name:
    > [sensor_name] Additional notes…”
    >
    > Ex. "This is Abram Fleishman on 8 Dec 2025 at 12:10 PM. I am at
    > Site 17 32.95332 N, -111.45922 W. I am deploying Sensor A01 at the
    > edge of a forest with tall trees to the west and a field to the
    > right. There is a goose nest 3 m to the SE of the sensor. "

5.  Switch to **USB/Off** for 5 seconds.

    -   Red LED will flash 1–4 times indicating battery level.

6.  Switch to **Custom** to start scheduled operation.

## Deploy the Sensor

1.  Return the sensor to its housing. **Make sure the microphone
    hole(orange box below) on the AudioMoth circuit board is oriented
    correctly in the case and lines up with the microphone hole on the
    case.**

    device.](images/am_mic_and_switch.jpg)

2.  Ensure SD card remains fully clicked in.

3.  Close the housing and mount to a Tree, stake or structure.

4.  Avoid placing the sensor in a way that the microphone is physically
    blocked or placing the sensor near rustling foliage or other loud
    features on the landscape (e.g. site that is exposed to high wind or
    loud running water, site near continuously occupied chicken coop or
    cattle corral).

5.  Confirm datasheet it fully filled out and complete.

During sleep between recordings, a single **green LED flashes every 2
seconds**. Refer to the LED guide if abnormal flashing occurs.
