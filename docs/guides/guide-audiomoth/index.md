# 🔊+🦉 Guide: Bioacoustics Basics with AudioMoth Sensors 

This guide provides an overview of the AudioMoth sensor workflow. These
materials introduce users to the complete lifecycle of deploying,
maintaining, and managing data from AudioMoth bioacoustic sensors, as
suggested by [Conservation Metrics (CMI)](https://conservationmetrics.com).

AudioMoth sensors are low-cost, open-source acoustic recorders used
widely in ecological monitoring. This guide walks through best practices
for preparing devices, configuring firmware and recording schedules,
conducting field deployments, managing redeployments, and processing
retrieved data. The goal is to ensure consistent, reliable data
collection across projects and teams.

## Guide Overview

### [**1. Sensor Preparation**](guides/guide-audiomoth/step-1-prepare-audiomoth)

How to prepare AudioMoth devices and microSD cards prior to deployment,
including firmware updates and required desktop and mobile applications.

### [**2. Sensor Programming**](guides/guide-audiomoth/step-2-programming-audiomoth)

Instructions for configuring the AudioMoth recording schedule, gain
settings, sampling rate, and time synchronization.

### [**3. Deployment Procedures**](guides/guide-audiomoth/step-3-deploying-audiomoth)

Field steps for creating intro recordings, mounting sensors, ensuring
correct LED behavior, and documenting deployments.

### [**4. Checking Sensors & Redeployment**](guides/guide-audiomoth/step-4-checking-redeploying-audiomoth)

Procedures for mid-season battery and card replacement, field-time
resets using the Chime app, and consistent metadata recording.

### [**5. Deployment Information Requirements**](guides/guide-audiomoth/step-5-field-deployment-metadata)

Descriptions of the required metadata fields for every deployment and
retrieval, with formatting rules and data-entry expectations.

### [**6. Data Management & Transfer**](guides/guide-audiomoth/step-6-audio-organization)

Guidance on offloading SD cards, project-level storage requirements,
data mule drives, and how to handle corrupted cards.

### [**Appendix 1: Testing Acoustic Sensors**](guides/guide-audiomoth/step-7-testing-sensors)

Guidance for testing acoustic sensors prior to field deployments.  This page
describes best practices to assure your acoustic hardware is functioning prior
to putting it out at remote sites for prolonged periods.
