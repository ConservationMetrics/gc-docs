# Step 5: Deployment Information Requirements

CMI requires standardized metadata for each sensor deployment. Each row
in the deployment spreadsheet represents **one device at one location
for one deployment**. A deployment begins when a sensor is placed in the
field and ends when that sensor is serviced (batteries/sd card changed) or retrieved from the field.

### Required Fields

-   **Sensor_Name** – Device nickname (e.g., SJ‑09)

-   **Card_ID** – Unique ID written on each SD card

-   **SPID** – Unique survey point ID (≤15 characters, no spaces or
    special characters other than underscore "\_")

-   **Latitude** – Decimal degrees (Y)

-   **Longitude** – Decimal degrees (X)

-   **Deployment_Date** – mm/dd/yyyy

-   **Deployment_Time** – hh:mm (24‑hour)

-   **Retrieval_Date** – mm/dd/yyyy

-   **Retrieval_Time** – hh:mm (24‑hour)

This information must be recorded in the field and entered into a table.
If using an app to collect this information on a smartphone or tablet,
please reach out to CMI when building the form/config you plan to use.
