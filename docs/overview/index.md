# About Guardian Connector

Guardian Connector is a free and open-source **Indigenous data sovereignty platform for communities** to securely centralize, access, and derive insights from their environmental and cultural data. Developed through collaboration between Indigenous communities, Conservation Metrics, and technical partners, Guardian Connector addresses the unique challenges faced by communities on the frontlines of protecting their territories.

## Why Guardian Connector Exists

Digital technology plays a key role in helping people gather information needed to make better decisions about community well-being and ecosystem health. However, many off-the-shelf tech solutions fail to meet the needs of Indigenous and other local communities with place-anchored relationships that protect over 80% of the world's biodiversity and over 35% of the world's intact forest landscapes.

Additionally, as mentioned in the UN Human Rights Council's Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples [Right of Indigenous Peoples to data, including with regard to data collection and disaggregation](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4087217?v=pdf) study, 

> Indigenous Peoples remain largely excluded from the collection, use and application of data about them, their lands and their cultures. Existing data and data infrastructure fail to recognize Indigenous knowledge and world views and do not meet Indigenous Peoples’ current and future data needs.

Guardian Connector is designed to meet the unique data needs and challenges of Indigenous partners, including:

🛡️ **Data Sovereignty**: Complete ownership and control over community data

📊 **Biocultural Metrics**: Access to indicators that reflect Indigenous perspectives on well-being

🔗 **Multi-tool Integration**: Easy use of datasets from multiple monitoring and data collection tools

⚡ **Real-time Alerts**: Near real-time notifications about territorial incursions and environmental changes

🏠 **On-premises Storage**: Data stored on infrastructure that communities own entirely

♻️ **Long-term Sustainability**: A platform designed to serve communities independently without dependency on outside support
