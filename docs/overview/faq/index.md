# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I use Guardian Connector?

Currently, Guardian Connector is in a research and development phase. We are working with a small number of community organizations to test the platform, gather feedback, and co-create new features. While the tools are open-source and can be self-hosted (see [For Developers](/reference/for-developers)), we are not yet ready to support users that are not partners of [Nia Tero](https://niatero.org/). We hope to be able to support more users in the future, and make it even easier to set up and use Guardian Connector yourself.
