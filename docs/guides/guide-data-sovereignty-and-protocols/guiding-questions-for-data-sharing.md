# Guiding Questions for Creating a Data Sharing Protocol

*This information is adapted from “Technocultural Data Protocols” from Foster & Schonwetter 2024, produced for the Tenure Facility.[^1]*

## :question: Guiding Questions

### Ownership and Control

* Who holds ownership and control over the database platform?  
* Where is the data stored, and who owns the servers?  
* What data privacy and management protocols are in place?

### Consent and Access

* How does the platform secure Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) for data use?  
* Are community members meaningfully involved in decisions around data collection and storage?

### Data Usage and Audience

* Who will access the data and maps? (General public, community members, NGOs, or governments)  
* How will the data be used? (Land negotiation, project visibility, community planning)

### Data Protection and Security

* Does the data storage platform align with the community’s values and governance protocols?  
* What steps protect against cybersecurity threats and unauthorized data use?

### Cultural Sensitivity and Equity

* Does the platform consider issues of gender equity in community mapping?  
* Are Indigenous Peoples’ narratives and priorities preserved in data representation?

### Data Evolution and Future Use

* How can the data be updated, and what protocols enable communities to change permissions?  
* What happens to the data if the managing organization dissolves?
