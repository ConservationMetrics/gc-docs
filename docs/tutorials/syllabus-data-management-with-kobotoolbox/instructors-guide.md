# Instructor's Guide

This guide is tailored to support facilitators running the weekly live sessions in the **4-week self-paced blended learning program**. The aim is to ensure every participant—regardless of digital literacy—feels included, confident, and engaged.

## 1. Communication & Support Channels

### WhatsApp as a Backchannel

* Use WhatsApp for quick, simple communication before and during the session.
* Share joining instructions, reminders, and a safe space for questions.
* Keep all messages short, clear, and friendly.

### Follow-Up and Recording

* Record each session for participants who cannot attend live.
* Send follow-up messages with key points, answers to questions, and links to resources.

## 2. Pre-Webinar Preparation

* **Low-friction access**: Share a one-click link, avoid complex forms, and include step-by-step joining instructions with screenshots or a short video if needed.
* **Tech check session**: Offer a brief “drop-in” slot before the event for audio, video, and connection tests.
* **Plain language reminders**: Replace jargon with simple, direct instructions (e.g., “Click the blue button to join”).

## 3. Opening the Session

* Begin with a warm greeting to create a welcoming atmosphere.
* Use low-tech icebreakers: thumbs-up on camera, show of hands, or a simple yes/no answer.

## 4. Keeping the Technology Simple

* Avoid unnecessary features or tools.
* Share only essential screens to reduce visual clutter.
* Verbally guide participants whenever changing visuals or tools.

## 5. Inclisive Engagement Strategies

* Favor voice interaction over typing.
* Include physical participation: hold up an object, write something on paper, or point to something nearby.
* Allow 5–7 seconds after questions to give time for thinking.
* Rephrase questions without making participants feel wrong.
* Celebrate every contribution warmly.
* Gradually increase interaction complexity.
* Normalize technical hiccups and treat them with humor.

## 7. Sustaining Energy and Attention

* Alternate 5–7 minutes of presentation with 1–2 minutes of interaction.
* Use analogies linked to everyday experiences.
* Rely on large, clear visuals rather than dense text.
* Use quick, low-tech polls (e.g., raise hands, thumbs-up).

## 8. Closing the Session

* Invite each participant to share one takeaway verbally or with a gesture.
* Send a brief recap via WhatsApp or email (short video or voice note preferred over long text).
* Keep the session open 5–10 minutes for informal discussion.

**Pro Tip:** Your calmness, clarity, and warmth are more valuable than any technical feature. If you’re confident with the tools, your participants will feel safe to explore and learn.
