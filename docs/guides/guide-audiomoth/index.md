# AudioMoth Guide

This guide provides an overview of the AudioMoth sensor workflow. These
materials introduce users to the complete lifecycle of deploying,
maintaining, and managing data from AudioMoth bioacoustic sensors, as
implemented by Conservation Metrics (CMI).

AudioMoth sensors are low-cost, open-source acoustic recorders used
widely in ecological monitoring. This guide walks through best practices
for preparing devices, configuring firmware and recording schedules,
conducting field deployments, managing redeployments, and processing
retrieved data. The goal is to ensure consistent, reliable data
collection across projects and teams.
