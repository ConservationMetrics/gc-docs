# KoboToolbox

[KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) is a free, open-source suite of tools for mobile data collection. It allows users to build forms, collect data in the field using mobile devices, and analyze the collected data through web-based interfaces. Originally developed for humanitarian contexts, KoboToolbox excels at creating surveys, questionnaires, and data collection forms that work reliably in challenging environments with limited connectivity.

## Why KoboToolbox is Integrated with GuardianConnector

- **Offline Capability**: Works without internet connectivity, crucial for remote conservation areas
- **Flexible Form Design**: Supports complex survey logic, media attachments, and GPS coordinates for location-based data
- **Community Empowerment**: Allows local communities to collect their own data about environmental issues and land rights
- **Standardized Data**: Ensures consistent data collection formats across different projects and regions
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Supports rapid data collection for time-sensitive environmental monitoring
- **Multi-language Support**: Enables data collection in local languages, important for community-based conservation
- **Generous Free Tier**: Allows 5,000 survey submissions per month and up to 1GB storage for their Community plan.
