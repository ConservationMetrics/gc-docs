# Week 4: Data Cleaning

## **ðŸ“˜ Introduction**

Data Cleaning is a very important part of the data collection process. Along the data collection journey, issues will arise that will affect how the data looks like, introducing issues like double entries, misspellings, missing data, changes of the data structure as the process evolves that will require you to make adjustments on the data to fit your analysis needs.

In this week's work, we will tackle this issue by understanding the different data cleaning purposes and potential tools that might be used for this. Although this is an introduction to data cleaning, it is a very tense topic.

We will not get chance to dig deeper. pointers will be shared with you throughout the process to learn more about this.
