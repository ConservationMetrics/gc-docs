# Guardian Connector Toolkit

## GC Scripts Hub

The [GC Scripts Hub](./gc-scripts-hub/index.md) is a collection of automation scripts designed to help communities guard and manage their land through data integration and workflow automation. Built on the [Windmill](https://www.windmill.dev/) platform, these scripts empower communities to connect different tools, automate data collection, and streamline their conservation workflows without requiring deep technical expertise.

## GC Explorer

The [GC Explorer](./gc-explorer/index.md) is a web-based data visualization tool that transforms your community's tabular data into interactive maps, galleries, and dashboards. Built specifically for GuardianConnector, it connects directly to your PostgreSQL database to display data collected from tools like CoMapeo, KoboToolbox, and other data collection platforms.
