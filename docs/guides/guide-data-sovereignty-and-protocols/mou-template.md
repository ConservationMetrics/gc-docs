The agreement acknowledges the collective ownership of data by Indigenous communities and the relational, reciprocal nature of Indigenous data, which is an extension of their sovereignty, cultural heritage, and self-determination. This MoU constitutes an expression of mutual intent, and is not a legally binding obligation.

This MoU is designed to ensure that any data shared aligns with the principles and values of IDSov. These values include:

1. **Self-Determination**: The community retains autonomous control over all decisions related to the collection, access, use, and dissemination of their data.  
2. **Collective Ownership and Governance**: Data from or about the community remains under their collective governance, to be used in ways that reflect their priorities, values, and cultural perspectives.  
3. **Protection and Stewardship**: This agreement ensures that the community’s data is safeguarded against misuse, unauthorized access, and potential exploitation.
