# Appendix 1: Testing Acoustic Sensors

Acoustic Sensors can have variable microphone quality depending on
damage, inconsistent manufacturing conditions, and exposure to
moisture/environmental conditions. We recommend testing all acoustic
sensors prior to deployment and retesting after any prolonged deployment
prior to redeploying.

A good way to test them is to use a recording of "white noise" (e.g.
[this youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HoNsgxKuqA)).

-   Play the white noise using a speaker set to "moderate" volume
    (indoor speaking voice volume is good).

-   Set each recorder in the same place (if doing one-by-one) and
    orientation and record a short \~5-10 second clip with the white
    noise playing.

-   Make sure to keep the speaker volume consistent.

-   Download the recordings from each sensor to a testing folder.

-   Open the folder in [Raven
    Lite](https://www.ravensoundsoftware.com/raven-lite-downloads/) or
    another software that renders spectrograms
    ([Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/)).

-   Ensure that the recordings from all sensors look the same
    (consistent pattern of noise on the spectrograms for each
    recording).

    quality was low. We would likely hold this sensor back until
    settings that produced similar recordings were
    determined.](images/am_test_rec_raven.jpg)

::: tip
Testing can become part of the Configuration workflow by added testing
before programming the sensor and formatting the memory cards. This can
identify faulty equipment early on avoiding costly equipment failures.
