# Timelapse

[Timelapse](https://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/) is a specialized software tool designed for analyzing camera trap images and videos in wildlife research and conservation. It provides powerful features for organizing, viewing, and analyzing large collections of wildlife images, including species identification, behavior analysis, and temporal pattern recognition. Designed to be accessible to users without scientific expertise, Timelapse is particularly valuable for long-term wildlife monitoring studies and biodiversity assessments.

## Why Timelapse is Integrated with Guardian Connector

- **Wildlife Monitoring**: Enables systematic analysis of camera trap data for biodiversity conservation efforts
- **Species Documentation**: Supports identification and cataloging of wildlife species in conservation areas
- **Indigenous Knowledge Integration**: Enables Indigenous communities to annotate media using their own taxonomies and species names, preserving traditional ecological knowledge
- **Community-Defined Tagging**: Allows communities to create and use their own classification systems and naming conventions for wildlife and environmental observations
- **Accessible Design**: Doesn't require scientific expertise to use, making wildlife monitoring accessible to community members
- **Research Support**: Facilitates scientific research on wildlife behavior, population dynamics, and ecological patterns
- **Evidence Collection**: Provides documented evidence of wildlife presence for conservation advocacy
