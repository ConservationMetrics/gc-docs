# Connected Applications

Guardian Connector serves as a centralized hub for collecting and aggregating data from multiple sources. By connecting to various data collection tools and platforms, Guardian Connector consolidates community-generated data into a unified database for streamlined management and access.

## Core Data Collection Tools

- **[KoboToolbox](./kobotoolbox/)** - Mobile data collection and survey management
- **[CoMapeo](./comapeo/)** - Offline-first mapping and data collection for communities
- **[Timelapse](./timelapse/)** - Camera trap image analysis and wildlife monitoring
  
These tools provide direct data feeds to Guardian Connector, enabling automatic synchronization of field-collected data into the central database.

## Other Data Sources

Guardian Connector can import and integrate data from various other external platforms commonly used by Indigenous communities and conservation organizations:

- **[ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com/)** - Esri's comprehensive cloud-based GIS platform for geospatial data management and analysis
- **[Global Forest Watch](https://www.globalforestwatch.org/)** - Real-time forest monitoring system providing deforestation alerts and satellite imagery
- **[Locus Map](https://www.locusmap.app/)** - Mobile mapping application for outdoor navigation and GPS data collection
- **[ODK](https://getodk.org/)** - Open-source mobile data collection platform for creating and deploying surveys. (Read about the differences between KoboToolbox and ODK [here](/reference/connected-applications/kobotoolbox/#kobotoolbox-or-odk).)
- **[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)** - Community-driven collaborative mapping project creating free geographic data
- **[QGIS](https://qgis.org/)** - Open-source desktop GIS application for advanced spatial analysis and cartography

These data source integrations enable Guardian Connector to aggregate information from diverse collection methods and platforms, creating a comprehensive repository of community data while maintaining data sovereignty and local control.
