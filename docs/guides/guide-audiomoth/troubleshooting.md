# Troubleshooting & Common Pitfalls
## USB Cable Problems

Many AudioMoth connection failures are caused by charge-only USB cables.
Always test your cable by confirming both data transfer and device recognition in the Config App.

If the device is not recognized, try a different cable and USB port before assuming hardware failure.

## Incorrect Time Setting

AudioMoths rely on the current device time when applying schedules.
Forgetting to set the time results in sensors starting hours or days late.

Always synchronize the clock immediately before programming or reprogramming.

## SD Card Failures

Symptoms: no files written, intermittent recording, or corrupted WAV files.

### Common causes:

Using cards not rated for sustained write speeds.

- Improperly formatted cards (e.g., FAT32 instead of exFAT for large capacities).

### Old or worn cards with high error rates.

Replace any card that shows repeated errors—SD card failure rates increase sharply with age.

## Housing Issues

- Loose housings can cause wind rumble or knocking noises in recordings.

- Incorrect gasket alignment or blocked microphone ports can severely degrade Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

- Always inspect the rubber seal for debris or compression wear before closing the case.

## "Early" Battery Failure

Batteries often fail sooner than expected by the estimates provided by the configuration. Symptoms of early battery failure (in contrast to other types of failures) are:

- fewer days of recordings than expected 
- recording schedule for the last couple days with recordings being inconsistent
- files being shorter than expected and inconsistent
- Many 0kb files 

Early battery failure is often caused by power draw from the SD card.  Not all SD cards are created equal and it is best to select a recommended card brand and model based on [SD Purchasing Guide](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/sd-card-guide).
