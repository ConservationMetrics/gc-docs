# Week 5: Final Project

This week is designed to be a culmination of the skills and knowledge you've acquired throughout the program, allowing you to **design and execute a complete survey project**. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each component:

Design and execute a complete survey project:

1. **Design:** Create a survey addressing a relevant topic.
    * This involves applying your understanding of KoboToolbox's purpose and features from [Week 1](./week-1), where you learned to **create and deploy a basic survey using the form builder**.
    * You should consider incorporating more advanced design elements, [such as **grouping questions** that have the same meaning or purpose, and applying **skip logic** to these groups or individual questions to control their visibility](./week-2#question-grouping-and-skip-logic).
    * Remember to explore the [**different question types available in KoboToolbox**](./week-3#kobo-question-types).
    * For efficiency and consistency, you can leverage the [**Question Library function**](./week-3#question-library) to save groups of questions as templates for reuse across different forms, which is valuable for frequently asked questions or long lists of options.
    * As a good practice for experimentation and safely making edits, you can [**clone an existing survey into a completely new project**](./week-3#cloning-surveys-for-practice) to leave the original project and its submissions untouched.

2. **Deployment:** Deploy the survey and collect sample data.
    * Building on Week 1 activities, you will need to **deploy** your designed survey and test it by submitting sample data.
    * Consider the data collection mechanisms available: the **Kobo Collect Android app** and **Webforms (Enketo)**.
    * You should also manage **survey user access and permissions**, which was a key objective in [Week 2](./week-2), ensuring effective survey management.
    * As you progress, you may need to **update your survey and redeploy it**, observing how **versioning works** to manage changes.

3. **Data Cleaning:** Clean the data to prepare it for your analysis.
    * While KoboToolbox provides simple mechanisms, they often **fall short** for this task. Therefore, you will likely need to rely on **external tools** such as **spreadsheet software** (e.g., LibreOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, Google Spreadsheets) or specialized data cleaning tools like **OpenRefine**.
    * It is crucial to be aware that if you perform edits to your form after starting to collect submissions, KoboToolbox creates **new columns for updated questions**, effectively separating data for different versions. This can make the **analysis tab within KoboToolbox unusable**, requiring you to **rely on external tools for data visualization** and **manual realignment** of data where it appears separated.

4. **Analysis:** Perform data analysis using a Spreadsheet tool and visualize results.
    * perform **basic data analysis using spreadsheets** and utilizing KoboToolbox's built-in reporting features.
    * Key techniques involve creating **pivot tables and charts to summarize data**. While the learning materials provided focus on Microsoft Excel for these techniques, the same methods apply to Google Spreadsheets or LibreOffice Calc.
    * You will need to **export collected data in various formats**, such as CSV and Excel, and explore how it looks in your preferred spreadsheet tool.
    * Remember that the **suggested workflow assumes that data cleaning and visualization primarily happen outside of KoboToolbox**, especially if forms were edited during the data collection process, as KoboToolbox's internal analysis tab might become unusable.

5. **Documentation:** Prepare a brief report summarizing your process and findings.
    * This final step serves as a summary of your entire project, showcasing your understanding of the **whole KoboToolbox workflow**.
    * While the sources outline the practical steps and tools for design, deployment, data cleaning, and analysis, they **do not provide specific details on the content or format of this final report**.
