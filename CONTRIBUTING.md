# Using Git

We use GitHub to host code, track issues, and accept pull requests.

## Git Branching

**We build and release from the `main` branch, so code merged here should always be stable.**

Prefer short-lived feature branches.
- Piecemeal progress towards broad code changes should merge to long-running branches until
  everything there is stable and deployable, at which point the long-running branch gets merged
  to `main`.
- Since short, coherent patches are easier to review, we code-review the individual PRs into
  the long-running feature branch (instead of review when merging the long-running branch to
  `main`)

# Contributing to the Documentation

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to build and host our documentation.

To contribute to the documentation, you can edit the files in the `docs` directory.

### Contribution Process

**External Contributors**: Unless you are a Conservation Metrics Inc. (CMI) team member, all contributions must be submitted as a pull request for review.

**CMI Team Members**: Core CMI team members may submit pull requests and merge without review, or commit directly to the main branch, at their discretion.

### Contribution Standards

Not everything in this repository needs to be perfect or polished. Our documentation is meant to be a living resource â€” something we can build on iteratively to meet partner needs in the moment, with plenty of opportunity for future refinement and improvement.

# Coding Style

## Prettier for JavaScript

All developers are expected to use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format their JavaScript 
code. Currently, we use the standard Prettier [configuration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html).

> To apply Prettier autoformatting you can configure your text editor to format on save [according
> to these docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)
> - For VS Code, set `editor.formatOnSave` to true in your editor config.
> or in a pre-commit hook [according to these docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html).
