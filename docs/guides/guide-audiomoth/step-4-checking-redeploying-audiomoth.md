# Step 4: Checking Sensors & Redeploying

If sampling spans \>30 days (or the amount of time the sensor is
estimated to record), replace batteries and SD cards at each check.

### Stopping a Deployment

1.  If the sensor is actively recording the red light will be flashing
    and if the sensor is sleeping a green light will be flashing. If
    there are no LEDs flashing then the batteries are likely dead.
    Either way, switch to **USB/Off**.

2.  Replace batteries and SD card with fresh ones.

### Resetting Time in the Field

Familiarize yourself with the [LED](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/led-guide) flashing patterns to ensure your redeployment is successful.

1.  Switch to **Custom** — If the LEDs show solid red + flashing green
    it means the date/time is not set.

2.  Hold smartphone with **Chime App** near the microphone.

3.  Tap **Play Chime**.

4.  Once red LED turns off and green LED flashes intermittently, the
    time has been successfully set.

### Intro Recording & Restart

1.  Switch to **Default** and Record audio notes:

    > “This is [name] on [date] at [time]. Site: [SPID]. Sensor name:
    > [sensor_name] Additional notes…”
    >
    > Ex. "This is Abram Fleishman on 8 Dec 2025 at 12:10 PM. I am at
    > Site 17 32.95332 N, -111.45922 W. I am deploying Sensor A01 at the
    > edge of a forest with tall trees to the west and a field to the
    > east. There is a goose nest 3 m to the SE of the sensor. "

2.  Switch to **USB/Off** for 5 seconds.

    -   Red LED will flash 1–4 times indicating battery level.

3.  Switch to **Custom** to to resume scheduled operation.

4.  Replace sensor in the same spot and orientation and record check
    time on datasheet.
