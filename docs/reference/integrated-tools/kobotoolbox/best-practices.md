# Best Practices and Usage Tips

This page covers practical lessons learned from using KoboToolbox in real-world scenarios, including common pitfalls and their solutions.

## Browser Compatibility and Data Collection Methods

### Avoid Enketo Web Forms on iOS Safari for Media Submissions

**Issue**: Using Enketo web forms in Safari on iPhone as a workaround for KoboToolbox's lack of a native iOS app can cause significant problems with file uploads.

**Best Practice**: 
- Use Android devices with the official KoboCollect app for surveys requiring media attachments (photos, audio, video)
- If iOS devices are necessary, consider alternative data collection workflows that don't rely on media submissions through the browser
- Test thoroughly in your target browser environment before deploying forms that require media uploads

### Enketo Duplicate Submission Issues on Some Browsers

**Issue**: Enketo sometimes successfully submits data to KoboToolbox but fails to clear the submission from the local browser cache, leading to duplicate submissions when users attempt to submit again.

**Solution**: 
1. Clear browser storage manually via DevTools:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Navigate to the **Application** tab
   - Select **Clear Data** to remove cached submissions
2. Train data collectors to recognize successful submission confirmations
3. Implement data validation workflows to identify and handle duplicates during data processing

**Prevention**: 
- Use the official KoboCollect Android app whenever possible for more reliable submission handling
- Regularly clear browser cache during extended data collection periods

## File Size Limitations

### Background Audio Recording Limits (10MB per file)

**Critical Limitation**: KoboToolbox has a **10MB file size limit per individual file**, which significantly impacts background audio recordings for interviews that may exceed 2 hours.

**File Format Recommendations**:
- Use `.amr` format for the longest recording duration (â‰ˆ2 hours at 10MB limit)
- Avoid higher quality formats for long interviews, as they will exceed the limit faster
- Plan interview segments to stay under the 2-hour threshold

**Planning Considerations**:
- Split long interviews into multiple shorter sessions
- Inform interviewers about the time limitation before starting
- Have a backup recording method for interviews expected to exceed 2 hours

:::note
This 10MB per-file limitation is not clearly documented in the [official KoboToolbox background audio documentation](https://support.kobotoolbox.org/recording-interviews.html).

### Overall Submission Size Limits

**Limit**: Each survey submission has a **100MB total size limit** across all attached files.

**Best Practices**:
- Calculate total file sizes before submission, especially for surveys with multiple media attachments
- Compress images and videos when possible while maintaining acceptable quality for your use case
- Consider splitting large data collections into multiple related submissions if necessary
- Monitor storage usage regularly, particularly for projects with extensive media collection

## Form Design and Deployment

### Form Structure Planning and Avoiding Data Fragmentation

**Issue**: Modifying form structure after data collection has begun can lead to data fragmentation, where the same logical field appears in multiple columns across your dataset.

**Example**: If you have a question `what_is_your_age` but later decide to move it into a group called `demographics` (making it `demographics/what_is_your_age`), submissions collected before and after the change will have age data in different columns. This creates cleanup work and potential data analysis complications.

**Best Practice**:
- Plan your form structure carefully before deployment, considering logical groupings and question organization
- Think through potential future changes and group related questions together from the start
- If structural changes are absolutely necessary after data collection has begun:
  - Document all changes and their dates
  - Plan for data consolidation during analysis
  - Consider whether it's worth creating a new form version versus data cleanup effort
- Test your form structure thoroughly with pilot data to identify organizational issues early

### Testing Workflows

**Before Deployment**:
- Test forms with actual media files in your target collection environment
- Verify file upload functionality across different devices and browsers
- Test offline functionality and synchronization if working in areas with limited connectivity
- Validate that all media files stay within size constraints

### Data Quality Assurance

**During Collection**:
- Implement regular data backup procedures
- Train collectors to recognize and report submission errors immediately
- Establish protocols for handling duplicate submissions
- Monitor submission success rates and file upload completion

## Storage and Infrastructure Planning

### Account Management and Tiers

**Free Tier Considerations**:
- 5,000 submissions per month limit
- 1GB total storage limit
- Monitor usage regularly to avoid service interruptions

**Paid Tier Planning**:
- Factor in media file sizes when estimating storage needs
- Consider the cost implications of media attachments (such as background audio recordings or image/video uploads) for large-scale projects
- Plan for additional storage costs early in project budgeting
- As of this writing, the cheapest paid plan is the Professional plan at $159 per month, which provides unlimited file storage. See [KoboToolbox Pricing](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/pricing) for up-to-date information.
