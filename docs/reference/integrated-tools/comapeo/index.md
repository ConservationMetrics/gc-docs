# CoMapeo

[CoMapeo](https://www.comapeo.app/) is an offline-first mapping and data collection tool designed specifically for indigenous communities and grassroots organizations. Built with a focus on data sovereignty and community control, CoMapeo allows communities to map their territories, document environmental changes, and collect evidence of environmental impacts without relying on external internet infrastructure.
