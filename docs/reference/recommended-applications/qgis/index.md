# QGIS

**QGIS** is a powerful open-source application for working with geographic data, such as shapefiles, geopackages, data collected using [CoMapeo](/reference/connected-applications/comapeo), and other spatial data formats. It allows you to create, edit, and visualize maps in countless ways. 

You can integrate QGIS with Guardian Connector in two main ways:

1. **Importing data** from Guardian Connector into QGIS for spatial analysis or visualization.
2. **Exporting processed data** or map outputs from QGIS back into Guardian Connector to enrich your datasets with geographic insights.

This makes QGIS a flexible and community-friendly tool for anyone working with land, territory, and spatial data.

## How to use QGIS with Guardian Connector

Please see the [Use your data in QGIS](/reference/common-workflows/use-your-data-in-qgis/) guide for detailed instructions.
