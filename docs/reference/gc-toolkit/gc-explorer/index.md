# GC Explorer

The [Guardian Connector Explorer (GC Explorer)](https://github.com/conservationmetrics/gc-explorer) is a web-based data visualization tool that transforms your community's tabular data into interactive maps, galleries, and dashboards. Built specifically for Guardian Connector, it connects directly to your PostgreSQL database to display data collected from tools like CoMapeo, KoboToolbox, and other data collection platforms.
