## 📄 Academic Papers

### Jennings, L., Jones, K., Taitingfong, R. et al. "Governance of Indigenous data in open earth systems science." _Nat Commun_ 16, 572. (2025)

**Summary**: In the age of big data and open science, what processes are needed to follow open science protocols while upholding Indigenous Peoples’ rights? The Earth Data Relations Working Group (EDRWG), convened to address this question and envision a research landscape that acknowledges the legacy of extractive practices and embraces new norms across Earth science institutions and open science research. Using the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) as an example, the EDRWG recommends actions, applicable across all phases of the data lifecycle, that recognize the sovereign rights of Indigenous Peoples and support better research across all Earth Sciences.

**Summary**: Indigenous Peoples are increasingly being sought out for research partnerships that incorporate Indigenous Knowledges into ecology research. In such research partnerships, it is essential that Indigenous data are cared for ethically and responsibly. Here we outline how the ‘CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance’ can sow community ethics into disciplines that are inundated with extractive helicopter research practices, and we provide standardized practices for evolving data and research landscapes.

**Summary**: Concerns about secondary use of data and limited opportunities for benefit-sharing have focused attention on the tension that Indigenous communities feel between (1) protecting Indigenous rights and interests in Indigenous data (including traditional knowledges) and (2) supporting open data, machine learning, broad data sharing, and big data initiatives. The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group (within the Research Data Alliance) is a network of nation-state based Indigenous data sovereignty networks and individuals that developed the ‘CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance’ (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, scholars, non-profit organizations, and governments. The CARE Principles are people– and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing innovation, governance, and self-determination among Indigenous Peoples. The Principles complement the existing data-centric approach represented in the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’ (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The CARE Principles build upon earlier work by the Te Mana Raraunga Maori Data Sovereignty Network, US Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network, Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Collective, and numerous Indigenous Peoples, nations, and communities. The goal is that stewards and other users of Indigenous data will ‘Be FAIR and CARE.’ In this first formal publication of the CARE Principles, we articulate their rationale, describe their relation to the FAIR Principles, and present examples of their application.

## 📊 Reports and Case Studies

### UN Human Rights Council, Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. "Right of Indigenous Peoples to data, including with regard to data collection and disaggregation." (2025)

**Link**: [https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4087217?v=pdf](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4087217?v=pdf)

**Summary**: The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has prepared the present study pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 33/25, analysing the right of Indigenous Peoples to data, including with regard to data collection and disaggregation. Expert Mechanism Advice No. 18 (2025) on the right of Indigenous Peoples to data is annexed to the study.

**Summary**: This report provides a starting point for how organizations can begin the process of developing a set of technocultural data protocols for safeguarding local communities’ and Indigenous Peoples’ rights to data sovereignty. Local communities and Indigenous Peoples are quite heterogenous with different histories and concerns, and several have begun to develop distinct Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles and Indigenous Data Governance protocols for how to protect and promote their data, knowledge, lands, and cultural heritage. In response, organizations must establish their own internal guidelines (e.g., technocultural data protocols) for how to align their policies and practices to ensure they are acting responsibly to safeguard the data of local communities and Indigenous Peoples whom they collaboratively work with. Technocultural data protocols, in other words, are policies and guidelines created by organizations to ensure that they are adhering to the Indigenous Data Governance requirements that Indigenous Peoples and local communities have established for themselves and those who handle their data.

**Summary**: This brief distills outcomes from the April 2024 US Indigenous Data Sovereignty & Governance Summit, asserting Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSov) and activating Indigenous Data Governance (IDGov) to safeguard rights affirmed in UNDRIP and related frameworks. Delegates outlined five strategies: define Indigenous core values for data futures; build an “Authority to Activation” framework linking Tribal leadership to practitioner action; create a U.S. Indigenous Data Governance Strategy; develop a U.S. Indigenous Peoples’ Data Standard; and reaffirm established IDSov/IDGov approaches. It calls stakeholders to co-develop policies, laws, and enforcement mechanisms (e.g., rights-based remedies, ceremony, justice, Indigenous-led standards) and draws on international models and the IEEE provenance effort. Overall, the brief centers community-specific values, relationships, and consent to ensure data practices benefit Indigenous Peoples and prevent extractive or harmful uses.

**Summary**: Consultation protocols can take multiple shapes and implications when it comes to Indigenous Peoples and the government or NGOs that aim to collaborate with them in their territories. Having experienced harmful and extractive outcomes from protocols designed by outsiders, the Wayana People in Suriname created their own, which is grounded in their traditional practices and values. In collaboration with Wayana-led Mulokot Foundation, Nia Tero and Cultural Survival, Digital Democracy created this guide that contains key steps, learnings and advice for other communities seeking to compile their own consultation protocol.

### Research Data Alliance International Data Sovereignty Interest Group. "Care Principles for Indigenous Data Governance." _The Global Indigenous Data Alliance_. (2019)

**Link**: [https://www.gida-global.org/s/CAREPrinciples_OnePagersFINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf](https://www.gida-global.org/s/CAREPrinciples_OnePagersFINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf) 

**Summary**: This piece introduces the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance—Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics—as a people- and purpose-oriented complement to FAIR that centers Indigenous rights affirmed in UNDRIP and the broader movement for Indigenous Data Sovereignty. It argues that as data’s value grows with digitization and connectivity, open data and open science often overlook power imbalances and the collective interests of Indigenous Peoples. CARE reframes data ecosystems to ensure benefits flow equitably to Indigenous communities (C1–C3), recognize and empower Indigenous authority and free, prior, and informed consent over data and knowledge (A1–A3), require relationship-based accountability and capacity building grounded in Indigenous languages and worldviews (R1–R3), and mandate ethical practices that minimize harm, advance justice, and govern future and secondary uses with clear provenance and obligations (E1–E3). Together, the principles provide a practical framework for data creation, access, stewardship, and reuse that enables self-determination, supports Indigenous innovation and governance, and aligns data practice with Indigenous values and collective interests.
