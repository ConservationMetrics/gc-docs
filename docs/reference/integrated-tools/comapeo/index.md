# CoMapeo

[CoMapeo](https://www.comapeo.app/) is an offline-first mapping and data collection tool designed specifically for indigenous communities and grassroots organizations. Built with a focus on data sovereignty and community control, CoMapeo allows communities to map their territories, document environmental changes, and collect evidence of environmental impacts without relying on external internet infrastructure.

## Why CoMapeo is Integrated with GuardianConnector

- **Data Sovereignty**: Gives communities full control over their data and mapping processes
- **Offline-First Design**: Works completely offline, essential for remote areas without internet access
- **Territory Mapping**: Enables communities to map traditional territories and document land use patterns
- **Environmental Documentation**: Supports documentation of environmental changes, deforestation, and ecological impacts
- **Evidence Collection**: Facilitates gathering of evidence for advocacy and legal proceedings
- **Cultural Preservation**: Allows communities to document traditional ecological knowledge and cultural sites
- **Peer-to-Peer Sync**: Enables data sharing between devices without requiring central servers
- **Archive Server**: A CoMapeo archive server (a.k.a. Comapeo Cloud) can be deployed to synchronize data to and from devices, and provides an API to connect with Guardian Connector
- **Customizable**: Supports community-specific categories and data structures
