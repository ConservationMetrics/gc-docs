# For Developers

Guardian Connector is built as an open-source ecosystem of interconnected tools designed to support Indigenous data sovereignty and community-based environmental monitoring. For developers interested in contributing, deploying, or extending Guardian Connector, these repositories provide the core building blocks and deployment infrastructure.

## Core Repositories

- **[Guardian Connector Deployment](https://github.com/ConservationMetrics/gc-deploy)** - Complete deployment guides and infrastructure setup for the Guardian Connector stack in cloud or on-premises environments
- **[Guardian Connector Scripts Hub](https://github.com/ConservationMetrics/gc-scripts-hub)** - Windmill-powered collection of scripts, workflows, and applications supporting land stewards worldwide
- **[Guardian Connector Explorer](https://github.com/ConservationMetrics/gc-explorer)** - Front end web application for unified visualization of geospatial and tabular community data across map, gallery, and dashboard views

## Development Philosophy

Guardian Connector development is guided by principles of:

- **Indigenous Data Sovereignty**: Communities maintain complete control over their data and infrastructure
- **Open Source Collaboration**: All components are freely available and encourage community contribution
- **Accessibility First**: Tools should be usable by community members without requiring advanced technical expertise
- **Modular Architecture**: Components work independently while integrating seamlessly
- **Community-Centered Design**: Features prioritize community needs over technical convenience

## Contributing

Guardian Connector welcomes contributions from developers who share our commitment to Indigenous data sovereignty and community-controlled environmental monitoring. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or proposing new integrations, your contributions help strengthen communities worldwide.

Each repository contains specific contribution guidelines, but all contributions should align with our core principles of accessibility, community control, and data sovereignty.
