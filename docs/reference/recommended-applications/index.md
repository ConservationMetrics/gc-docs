# Recommended Applications

Within the data ecosystem, there are many tools available for a variety of tasks. Throughout our own data journey, we’ve come across several that stand out—particularly those that align with the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty.

If you're unfamiliar with these principles, we encourage you to visit our overview page on **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** to understand their importance and implications for technology selection.

Below, we share a few applications that we’ve found useful. Each of them will have a dedicated page with more detailed information, so this is just a brief introduction.

## QGIS

**QGIS** is a powerful open-source application for working with geographic data. It allows you to create, edit, and visualize maps in countless ways. 

You can integrate QGIS with Guardian Connector in two main ways:

1. **Importing data** from Guardian Connector into QGIS for spatial analysis or visualization.
2. **Exporting processed data** or map outputs from QGIS back into Guardian Connector to enrich your datasets with geographic insights.

This makes QGIS a flexible and community-friendly tool for anyone working with land, territory, and spatial data—key components of Indigenous data governance.

## OpenRefine

**OpenRefine** is a powerful tool for cleaning and transforming datasets. It’s especially helpful when dealing with large amounts of messy data, such as survey responses or records collected in the field.

OpenRefine excels at tasks such as:

- Identifying and correcting inconsistent values (e.g., typos or alternate spellings)
- Discarding unnecessary columns
- Restructuring columns or rows
- Enriching data by pulling in information from external sources (e.g., reconciling names or codes)
- Removing outliers or duplicates
- Filling in missing fields or renaming headers for clarity

One of its strengths is that it allows you to **create reusable transformation steps**. Once you've cleaned one dataset, you can apply the same steps to future datasets with similar structures. This makes it a great companion for iterative data work, where your understanding and structure evolve over time.
