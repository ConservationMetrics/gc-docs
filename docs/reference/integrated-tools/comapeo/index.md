# CoMapeo

[CoMapeo](https://www.comapeo.app/) is an offline-first mapping and data collection tool designed specifically for indigenous communities and grassroots organizations. Built with a focus on data sovereignty and community control, CoMapeo allows communities to map their territories, document environmental changes, and collect evidence of environmental impacts without relying on external internet infrastructure.

## Why CoMapeo is Integrated with GuardianConnector

- **Data Sovereignty**: Gives communities full control over their data and mapping processes
- **Offline-First Design**: Works completely offline, essential for remote areas without internet access
- **Territory Mapping**: Enables communities to map traditional territories and document land use patterns
- **Environmental Documentation**: Supports documentation of environmental changes, deforestation, and ecological impacts
- **Evidence Collection**: Facilitates gathering of evidence for advocacy and legal proceedings
- **Cultural Preservation**: Allows communities to document traditional ecological knowledge and cultural sites
- **Peer-to-Peer Sync**: Enables data sharing between devices without requiring central servers
- **Customizable**: Supports community-specific categories and data structures

## Available CoMapeo Category Collections

CoMapeo uses customizable categories (icons with names) to organize and visualize mapping data. Communities can adapt these to their specific monitoring needs and contexts.

The [CoMapeo Categories Library](https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/welcome-to-the-comapeo-categories-library/) provides three pre-built collections that you can try out with CoMapeo:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Impact Monitoring
Categories for documenting external threats and environmental impacts from industries, illegal activities, and pollution.

### üê¶ Biodiversity Monitoring
Categories for mapping and monitoring wildlife, plants, water bodies, and other forms of biodiversity within territories.

### üåÄ Cultural Mapping
Categories for documenting traditional ecological knowledge, cultural sites, and ancestral relationships with the land.

### üîß Customization and Development
All category collections are available on GitHub at [digidem/comapeo-category-library](https://github.com/digidem/comapeo-category-library) where you can fork the repository for further customization to meet your community's specific needs.
